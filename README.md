# Digit recognizer - Overview
The repository contains the zip file for the analysis and the submission CSV file.
The repository's purpose is to sharpen machine learning skills.

# Dataset
The dataset contains the pixel values extracted in each row with a digit label. The goal is to use the pixel values
to predict the digit, which is from zero to nine.

# The current works
The current implementations include:
- random forest algorithms with grid search
- three-layer feed-forward neural network model
- convolutional neural network (CNN) model

# Summary
Currently, the CNN model achieves a score of 0.98735 on the test set, which is higher than the other models used.

# Reference
The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
