# Digit recognizer - Overview
The repository contains the zip file for the analysis and the submission CSV file.
The repository's purpose is to practice machine learning skills and work with others as a team, using Git/GitHub.
Therefore, the technical documentation and comments are significant for readability and understandability apart from
the model building.

# Dataset
The dataset contains the pixel values extracted in each row with a digit label. The goal is to use the pixel values
to predict the digit, which is from zero to nine.

# The current works
The current implementations include:
- random forest algorithms with grid search
- three-layer feed-forward neural network model

# Reference
The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer).
